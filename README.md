#Peace and plenty comming unto us, if we be willing to entertain them and will bid them welcome: manifested in some observations upon the motion lately made by certain persons sitting usually at Salters-Hall in Bread-street London, and there imployed about raising of new regiments of horse and foot: viz. that all well-affected families and persons would forbear one meal in a week, and give the value thereof, for, and toward the raising and maintaining of the said regiments. Written by one, who hath heard and seen somewhat said and done, for and against the same motion, and desireth that it may be more fully understood and furthered, tending (as he conceiveth) so much unto the publique good.#
